/**
 * Smart per-service routing for a MANUAL multi-service redeploy.
 *
 * Traces which services' roots changed between the active deployment's commit
 * and the new HEAD and rebuilds ONLY those, so the version atomically captures
 * the affected services. This is the dashboard "Redeploy" button's path.
 *
 * ORCHESTRATOR, not a classifier: it composes `compareCommits` (the git diff)
 * with the SHARED leaf classifiers in github/webhook-changed-files
 * (`classifyChangedFiles` / `routeServicesByChanges`) — the exact same matching
 * the webhook uses, so per-service targeting is identical with no duplicated
 * logic. It deliberately imports NOTHING from build.service, staying a leaf.
 *
 * Falls back to a full rebuild (`forceAll`) for single-app / same-commit /
 * config-only / can't-diff cases so a manual redeploy never silently no-ops, and
 * the `skip` mode (routable services exist but none matched) also collapses to
 * `forceAll` — a human clicked Redeploy and must get SOMETHING (the webhook, by
 * contrast, treats `skip` as a no-op since a no-op push shouldn't deploy).
 *
 * Inert unless `smartRoute` is set and the caller hasn't already decided routing
 * (`forceAll` / `serviceIds`) and this isn't an atomic reuse/rollback.
